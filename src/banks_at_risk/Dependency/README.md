Dependency:

This function takes the ENCORE dependency materiality ratings and calculates the dependency score for each EXIOBASE sector.

The dependency.py runs the necessary functions from helpers_dependency.py to generate the scores for the three methdological treatments (mean, max, min) for the sensitivity analysis. 

The dependency scores are stored in the Dependencies Score subfolder within the Data folder.
