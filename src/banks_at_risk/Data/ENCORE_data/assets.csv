Asset,Description,Data needs
Atmosphere,The atmosphere is the mass of air surrounding the earth. It's components (such as oxygen) and it's processes (such as temperature regulation)  support a number of essential ecosystem services.,Current seasonality of precipitation and temperature and wind
Habitats,"Habitats refer to the conditions of the environment necessary for life to prosper. These conditions vary widely between species but can include such elements as water and food availability, temperature range, or absence of predators. Habitats can be defined very narrowly for one population of a particular species or more widely by type such as forests or coastal habitats that host many different species.",Change in habitat quality
Land geomorphology,"Land geomorphology describes the structure of the land, such as mountains and valleys. Land geomorphology supports the provision of regulatory services, like erosion control.",Change in land geomorphology
Minerals,Minerals are naturally occuring compounds not produced by living beings. They can be metallic or non-metallic and play an important supporting role in the provision of services like soil quality.,Change in lithology
Ocean geomorphology,"Ocean geomorphology describes the structure of the marine environment such as shelfs and slopes. Ocean geomorphology supports the provision of regulatory services, like dilution by ecosystems.",Change in ocean geomorphology
Soils and sediments,"Soils and sediments are the layers of the earth's surface that support life. They comprise top-soil, sub-soil and ocean sediments and support a number of regulatory services.",Degree of soil degradation
Species,"Species includes plants, animals, fungi, algae and genetic resources, which can be wild or domestic/commercial, for example livestock. Like habitats, species underpin a wide range of ecosystem services.","Change in livestock density, species abundance or occurrence and carbon"
Water,"Water includes surface water, ground water, ocean water, fossil water and soil water. Water is essential for a wide range of ecosystem services.",Change in availability of surface and ground water
