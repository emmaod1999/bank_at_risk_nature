Driver of environmental change,Description,Data needs
Diseases,"Harmful pathogens and microbes that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities.",Change in disease vector abundance
Droughts,Periods in which rainfall falls below the normal range of variation.,Change in drought severity
Earthquakes,"Earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. They may also cause associated events such as tsunamis, landslides, or even volcanic activity.",Change in earthquake everity
Fire,Suppression or increase in fire frequency and/or intensity outside of its natural range of variation.,Change in fire severity
Flooding,Extreme precipitation events leading to the submergence of dry land.,Change in flood severity
Landslides,Landslide events leading to geological changes.,Change in landslide severity
Habitat modification,"Major changes in habitat composition and location, for example deforestation.",Change in land use and land cover
Human modification of genetic material,Human altered or transported organisms or genes.,Change in GM modification severity
Human movement,"Migration by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily in a new location.",Change in immigration and emigration
Industrial or domestic activities,Non-agricultural human activities including non-consumptive use of resources.,Change in population density and shipping activity
Industrial or domestic construction,Process of constructing a building or infrastructure for industrial or domestic purposes.,Change in construction activity
Intensive agriculture and aquaculture,"Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas).",Change in agricultural activity
Invasive species,"Harmful plants, animals, pathogens and other microbes not originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question and directly or indirectly introduced and spread into it by human activities.",Change in number of invasive species
Ocean acidification,Changes to the ocean chemistry which occurs when carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere and reacts with seawater to produce acid.,Change in ocean acidification
Ocean current and circulation,Large scale movement of waters in the ocean basins.,Change in ocean currents
Overfishing,"The harvesting of aquatic wild animals or plants at a rate that is greater than their capacity for regeneration. Harvesting can occur for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research, or cultural purposes, or for control/persecution reasons; accidental mortality/bycatch are also included.",Change in fisheries production
Overharvesting,"The harvesting of plants, fungi, trees and other woody vegetation, and other non-timber/non-animal products at a rate that is greater than their capacity for regeneration. The harvesting can occur for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research or cultural purposes, or for control reasons.",Change in number of species traded
Overhunting,"The killing or trapping terrestrial wild animals or animal products at a rate that is greater than their capacity for regeneration. The killing or trapping can occur for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research or cultural purposes, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch.",Change in hunted species
Pests,"Harmful plants or animals that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities.",Change in pest abundance
Pollution,Threats arising from the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment.,Change in level of pollution
Population changes,Changes in species populations over time and space.,Change in species populations
Sea level rise,Increase in global mean sea level as a result of an increase in the volume of water in the world's oceans or heat dilation.,Change in sea level rise
Sea surface temperature,Periods in which sea surface temperatures exceed or go below the normal range of variation.,Change in sea surface temperature
Storms,Extreme precipitation and/or wind events.,Change in storm severity
Volcanoes,Volcanic events which may lead to changes in natural capital assets.,Change in severity of volcanic eruptions
Water abstraction,Changing water flow patterns from their natural range of variation due to human activities.,Change in surface and ground water use levels
Weather conditions,Weather conditions outside of the natural range of variation.,Change in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation and wind
